## About generate_emu_config_old
Old tool that is moved from gse_fork to here. Not to be confused with an old or obsolete version in any way, this is actually the overhauled version, with a lot of bugfixes, improvements, new features, new file structure, new helper tools. 
Unlike the original 'not edited' one from upstream gbe_fork_tools (or gbe_fork for full commit history), this has been thoroughly tested and fixed to properly work with a lot of different usage scenarios like for example batch generating and properly skipping invalid appids, or generating for appids of steam events or steam tools.
